# Woocommerce-Product-Bundles-Bulk-variation-selector-addon

The Product Bundles - Bulk Variation selector plugin enhances WooCommerce's Product Bundles by allowing store owners to define a main variation that dynamically applies to all products within a bundle. This feature simplifies the purchasing process by enabling customers to select a single variation (e.g., size, color) that is consistently applied across all bundled items.

Key Features:

Adds an option to enable main variation selection for bundles in the product settings.
Displays a variation dropdown on the product page when enabled.
Dynamically updates bundled products based on the selected main variation.
Validates variation selection before adding bundles to the cart.
Supports common attributes across bundled products, ensuring compatibility.
Ideal for stores selling bundles with variable products where consistent variation selection improves user experience.
